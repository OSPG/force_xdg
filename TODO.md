TODO: It'd be nice if we documented all the implemented fixes, what program they're related to (the source code, maybe the related XDG issue, if it exists...)

TODO: Make a Makefile which supports `environment`, `activation-list`, `user-install`, `install`, `clean`, `system-purge`, `user-purge`.

TODO: Delete `setup.sh`, replace it with an executable `force_xdg` which supports the same commands as Makefile.
